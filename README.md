Game Description
----------------

While inventing a machine that can launch itself into the heavens and land on the moon, you have run out of precious gems that you use to power your engine. You must venture into the dangerous unknown in search of these gems, armed only with your steam-powered aeropack.

While inventing a machine that can launch itself into the heavens and land on the moon, you have run out of precious gems that you use to power your engine. You must venture into the dangerous unknown in search of these gems, armed only with your steam-powered aeropack.

It's not as easy as it seems because at every corner you must watch out for steam-powered pixelbots, bouncing gears, and dangerous cannons launching purple bullets at you. Be sure to pick up fuel tanks when you find them to stay in the air, and be careful of the special moving and bouncy platforms.


Insurgent Games
---------------

Insurgent Games was founded in 2009 by Micah Lee and Crystal Mayer out of their San Francisco studio apartment. For a couple of years they made iPhone and Android games while doing other work on the side. They quickly realized that unless you're incredibly lucky, it's hard to make enough money doing indie mobile game development to pay San Francisco rent, and so Micah got a full time job and Crystal moved on to other things.

Now, several years later, Micah works for the Electronic Frontier Foundation defending internet users from evil (https://www.eff.org/files/xkcd_comic.png), and Crystal is a freelance web designer (http://moonsprocket.com/). But Insurgent Games is dormant.

Since we're not working on the games anymore, we decided to release them to the community where maybe they can thrive and be reborn as bigger and better things. All of our games are licensed under the GNU General Public License.
